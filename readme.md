# Configuration Management


Configuration information such as the database url/port, credentials, API keys etc are to be supplied to the application. However, it is bad practice to stage production information in publicly visible repositories.
Instead, all config is provided by a config file or via [environment variables](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-set-and-list-environment-variables-in-linux/).


# Flask Commands

wsgi.py is a utility script for performing various tasks related to the project. You can use it to import and test any code in the project. 
You just need create a manager command function, for example:

```python
# inside wsgi.py

user_cli = AppGroup('user', help='User object commands')

@user_cli.cli.command("create-user")
@click.argument("username")
@click.argument("password")
def create_user_command(username, password):
    create_user(username, password)
    print(f'{username} created!')

app.cli.add_command(user_cli) # add the group to the cli

```

Then execute the command invoking with flask cli with command name and the relevant parameters

```bash
$ flask user create bob bobpass
```


# Running the Project

_For development run the serve command (what you execute):_
```bash
$ flask run
```

_For production using gunicorn (what the production server executes):_
```bash
$ gunicorn wsgi:app
```

# Deploying
You can deploy your version of this app to render by clicking on the "Deploy to Render" link above.

# Initializing the Database
When connecting the project to a fresh empty database ensure the appropriate configuration is set then file then run the following command. This must also be executed once when running the app on heroku by opening the heroku console, executing bash and running the command in the dyno.

```bash
$ flask init
```

# Database Migrations
If changes to the models are made, the database must be'migrated' so that it can be synced with the new models.
Then execute following commands using manage.py. More info [here](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

```bash
$ flask db init
$ flask db migrate
$ flask db upgrade
$ flask db --help
```





# Troubleshooting

## Views 404ing

If your newly created views are returning 404 ensure that they are added to the list in main.py.

```python
from App.views import (
    user_views,
    index_views
)

# New views must be imported and added to this list
views = [
    user_views,
    index_views
]
```

## Cannot Update Workflow file

If you are running into errors in gitpod when updateding your github actions file, ensure your [github permissions](https://gitpod.io/integrations) in gitpod has workflow enabled ![perms](./images/gitperms.png)

## Database Issues

If you are adding models you may need to migrate the database with the commands given in the previous database migration section. Alternateively you can delete you database file.
